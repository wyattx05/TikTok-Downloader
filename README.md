### Download your TikToks before the ban ðŸš¨
Simple python script that downloads all your tikToks from the list of links you get when you download your data.

## Instructions
1) Download the download.py file
2) Create a lists.txt file and add all the links to that file one on each line
3) run download.py and your videos should download

I used VSCode to manage it all
