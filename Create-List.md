# How to Create a list of links

### This document will show you how to quickly create your list of links so you don't have to do it manually

1) Convert your post.txt file to an excel spreadsheet
2) Go to find words on documents and replace Link: with nothing
3) Use the find tool again and search for https and select every item (these are all the links)
4) Copy those links into a new spreedsheet and then copy them into the list.txt
